## Project Description
This was a two quarter long project worked on a group of 4 people. The idea was to create a web app that would considilate sport information 
from many different leagues. This also would include allowing users to create a custom profile which would allow them to pick leagues, teams and players. 
Lastly, we would include social media like X, formerly known as Twitter, Reddit and other social media sites we could include.

Unfortuntely, the project stopped working and I've taken the task to refactor the whole projcet. The biggest change is that instead of ReactJs, the project uses NextJs. Everything else is mostly the same but there a lot of changes.
